# Tetris
Tetris implementation using OOP.  

# Description
i tried design object-oriented, unlike procedural. e.g.) block, piece, cool_timer.  
and i used design patterns like factory, composite, observer and singleton.  
each square block created from factory and added into manager.  
and it has square blocks and update by own state.
